/** BOX SHADOW - CSS3
/** ---------------------------------------- --> 



CSS3 Box Shadow is a new property to add shadow effects to any html Element. You can choose your own color, offset, blur, spread, offset and repetition. Unlike border, it not a part of CSS Box Model, thus doesn't effect the layout even if it is bigger in size. Also we can add multiple shadows with different colors and offsets.
